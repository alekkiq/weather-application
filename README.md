# weather-application
Application that transforms pre-given json data to a chart, theme being monthly weathers. School project which was done in groups.

What was this project about?
- Working as a group
- Turning pre-given json data to charts with html canvas
- Single-page-application with REST to retrieve json

What I learned
- Working as an active group member; communication, sharing the work between all three group members
- Drawing to a canvas using retrieved json data
- REST and SPA mechanics

Flaws
- Poor parameterization
